Hey, have you heard the latest about Alex? People are saying he... glows. I know, it sounds crazy, right? But, like, several folks have noticed it now.

It's not just that "he's in a good mood" like he's seriously glowing. Bob from accounting swears he saw Alex with this weird light around him the other day. And then Karen from HR chimed in, saying she noticed it too when they were in a meeting.

Now everyone's speculating. Some think it's just the lighting in the office messing with their eyes. Others are joking that maybe he's got some kind of superhero thing going on. I mean, can you imagine? Alex, of all people, secretly being a superhero?

But yeah, it's got everyone buzzing. If you see him, maybe pay attention and see if you notice anything... unusual.
